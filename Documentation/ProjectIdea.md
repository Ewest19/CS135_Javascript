# Kitchen Buddy

### Overview
This project will be creating a grocery list and recipe organizer! This app will allow you to know what you need to get from the store and will store information about ingredients and recipes that you have and use. 

### Features

# Recipe Cards
Recipe cards will allow you to store recipes! These recipe cards can then be used for an easy way to figure out what to make and a simple place to store all those recipe books.

# Grocery List
The grocery list will be a list for when you go to the grocery store, except it can be adjusted based on what recipes you have used since the last time you went as well as recipes you plan on using soon!

# Pantry List
The pantry list is a place to store all the ingredients that you currently have in your kitchen! This makes it easy to find a recipe that you are able to make, or to add ingredients needed to your grocery list!
